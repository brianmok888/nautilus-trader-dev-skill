# Learn NautilusTrader

## NT V2 Rust readiness gates

This repository cutover card records the current state of this skill. For future work, re-run the cited evidence and change a row to `Pending` or `Blocked` whenever that work lacks proof; `Pass` requires an explicit command, file, or official URL.

NT v2 compatibility note: readiness-table mentions of legacy Cython/v1 and Python live TradingNode are migration/reference-only; prefer Rust v2/PyO3 and LiveNode for new work.

| Gate | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G0 Scope and ownership | Confirm the pinned developer-guide snapshot and record the current-develop overlay before copying APIs. | Pass | `uv run python tools/check_dev_guide_snapshot_sync.py` passed against pinned upstream `6e59fd74eaacacbb7410936f1766bd89fcce6f59`; `references/upstream-delta-review.json` records the reviewed current-develop delta. This gate does not certify every official-doc page or release tag. |
| G1 Legacy labelling | No Cython/v1/TradingNode guidance remains unlabelled outside source-pinned upstream snapshots. | Pass | `uv run python tools/check_dev_guide_sync.py` passed; `uv run pytest -q tests/test_dev_guide_sync.py -k 'legacy or cython or v1 or tradingnode'` passed 27 tests. |
| G2 Pinned V2 examples | Compile or validate examples applicable to this skill against the pinned NT V2 baseline. | Pass | `uv run python tools/check_skill_g2_harnesses.py --execute --skill nt-learn` passed the skill domain's scoped examples and owners against `6e59fd74eaacacbb7410936f1766bd89fcce6f59`; schema-v2 provenance is recorded in `references/g2-evidence/nt-learn.json`. |
| G3 Rust bindings/PyO3 | Validate the selected Rust/PyO3 ownership, registration, and callback boundaries exercised by the repository checks. | Pass | `uv run pytest -q tests/test_v2_guidance_hardening.py -k 'pyo3 or binding or rust or live_runner'` passed 10 selected ownership and callback boundary tests. |
| G4 Functional gates | Classify migration-only Python, active AI/advisory Python, bounded PyO3 control-plane, and Rust production lanes while using current V2 API shapes. | Pass | `uv run pytest -q tests/test_markdown_lane_contract.py tests/test_template_classification.py tests/test_v2_guidance_hardening.py` passed; `uv run python tools/check_dev_guide_snapshot_sync.py` matched all 18 pinned guide bodies. |
| G5 References and templates | Collect readiness-focused checker, targeted test, lint, or build evidence before marking implementation complete. | Pass | `uv run pytest -q --ignore=tests/test_quality_gates.py` passed; `uv run python tools/check_dev_guide_sync.py` passed. |
| G6 Operational and migration boundaries | Run selected repository policy checks for legacy labels, the AI advisory boundary, and Rust-first lane guidance. | Pass | `uv run pytest -q tests/test_dev_guide_sync.py tests/test_v2_guidance_hardening.py tests/test_rust_first_end_to_end.py -k 'safety or fail_closed or precision or overflow or secret or async or ffi or audit or legacy or cython or v1 or advisory'` passed 26 selected repository policy checks; change-specific deterministic ordering, precision/overflow, secrets, async, FFI, and audit evidence remains required where applicable. |
| G7 Durable evidence | Report changed paths, validation commands, evidence, and unresolved gates. | Pass | Current per-skill evidence is recorded in `references/g2-evidence/nt-learn.json`; repository closure is summarized in `docs/tracking/Findings.md`. |

AI and advisory work are outside this repository and must not be introduced into NautilusTrader production paths.

Learning gates: the active curriculum uses Rust for research, configuration, backtests, strategies, adapters, and live runtime work. Older Python labs are migration/reference-only; non-NautilusTrader development lanes are outside this repository. Learners mark `Pending` until they can run the matching Rust build/test/check commands and explain each gate.

This is the Rust-first curriculum. Its legacy/Python labelling points only to
physically quarantined migration material, not an active implementation lane.

## Rust production lane

Teach the Rust architecture, model types, data flow, strategy lifecycle, backtest runtime, and `LiveNode` path as the default progression toward production readiness. A learner completes this lane by building and testing Rust components and explaining deterministic ordering, fixed-point precision, risk, and lifecycle boundaries.

## PyO3 control-plane lane

Teach PyO3 as the bounded interface for typed configuration, Rust component registration, node lifecycle control, and result inspection. Learners must be able to explain why Python does not own order execution, market-data handlers, risk decisions, adapter state, or live-node liveness.

## Migration/reference lane

Older Python and v1 curriculum material belongs under `migration_reference/` and is used only to understand or migrate an existing system. The only active Python lane is AI/advisory, which remains asynchronous and non-authoritative.

## Source-pinned upstream lane

Anchor lessons and API exercises to [`references/developer_guide/rust.md`](../../references/developer_guide/rust.md) at immutable commit `6e59fd74eaacacbb7410936f1766bd89fcce6f59`, and identify newer upstream examples as version-scoped before using them.

## Overview

A structured Rust-first pathway from installation and domain concepts through
Rust strategies, adapters, backtests, PyO3 control boundaries, and complete Rust
trading systems. Historical Python strategies are migration/reference-only.

## Workflow

1. Ask: "What's your current level with NautilusTrader?"
   - **Brand new** → Start at Stage 01
   - **Can run examples** → Start at Stage 03
   - **Can write strategies** → Start at Stage 05
   - **Want to learn Rust internals** → Start at Stage 08
   - **Want to write full Rust trading systems** → Start at Stage 09
   - **Want to build/extend NT** → Start at Stage 10
2. Work through stages sequentially from entry point
3. Each stage has concepts, exercises, and a checkpoint
4. Ask user for local NT path at first source exploration
