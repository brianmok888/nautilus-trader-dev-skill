## NT V2 Rust readiness gates

This repository cutover card records the current state of this skill. For future work, re-run the cited evidence and change a row to `Pending` or `Blocked` whenever that work lacks proof; `Pass` requires an explicit command, file, or official URL.

NT v2 compatibility note: readiness-table mentions of legacy Cython/v1 and Python live TradingNode are migration/reference-only; prefer Rust v2/PyO3 and LiveNode for new work.

| Gate | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G0 Upstream baseline | Confirm the upstream snapshot, official docs, release tag, and local reference baseline before copying APIs. | Pass | Snapshot recorded in `tools/check_dev_guide_sync.py` as 6e59fd74eaacacbb7410936f1766bd89fcce6f59. |
| G1 Legacy label | No Cython/v1/TradingNode guidance remains unlabelled outside source-pinned upstream snapshots. | Pass | `uv run python tools/check_dev_guide_sync.py` passed block-scoped legacy/Cython/v1 and TradingNode enforcement; `tests/test_dev_guide_sync.py` covers leakage and exemption boundaries. |
| G2 V2 example validation | Compile or validate examples applicable to this skill against the pinned NT V2 baseline. | Pass | 2026-07-28: `uv run python tools/check_skill_g2_harnesses.py --execute --skill nt-learn` passed against pinned upstream commit `6e59fd74eaacacbb7410936f1766bd89fcce6f59`; machine-checked scope and execution provenance are recorded in `references/g2-evidence/nt-learn.json`. |
| G3 Rust bindings/PyO3 | Rust bindings, PyO3 registration paths, callback routing, and crate ownership match current nautilus_core/V2 boundaries. | Pass | `uv run pytest -q tests/test_v2_guidance_hardening.py tests/test_dev_guide_sync.py` passed PyO3 registration, live-runner callback, Rust ownership, and V2 boundary regressions. |
| G4 Lane and API shape | Classify supported Python V2, AI/advisory, config/control-plane, and Rust hot-path lanes while using current V2 API shapes. | Pass | `uv run pytest -q tests/test_template_classification.py tests/test_v2_guidance_hardening.py` passed the 34-template inventory and V2 API regressions; `uv run python tools/check_dev_guide_snapshot_sync.py` matched all 18 pinned guide bodies. |
| G5 Test evidence | Collect readiness-focused checker, targeted test, lint, or build evidence before marking implementation complete. | Pass | 2026-07-28: `uv run pytest -q --ignore=tests/test_quality_gates.py` passed 270 tests; `uv run python tools/check_dev_guide_sync.py` passed. |
| G6 Safety/compliance | Enforce fail-closed risk, deterministic ordering, fixed-point precision/overflow, secrets, async runtime, FFI, and audit boundaries. | Pass | `uv run pytest -q tests/test_dev_guide_sync.py tests/test_v2_guidance_hardening.py` passed 110 safety, runtime, FFI, legacy, and V2 boundary regressions. |
| G7 Completion report | Report changed paths, validation commands, evidence, and any Pending or Blocked readiness gates. | Pass | Cutover commits `9287019`, `6fc068b`, `44befad`, and `1707424` were pushed to `origin/main`; independent post-fix code review returned APPROVE and architecture review returned CLEAR, with no residual G2 Pending gates. |

AI/advisory lane remains Python and off execution-critical paths; it stays asynchronous, approval gate protected, and non-authoritative for Rust production paths. Rust production paths must not depend on it for order placement, risk checks, adapter state, or live-node liveness.

Learning gates: the Rust-first curriculum is the default for production readiness, while Python labs are labelled Python research/config or AI/advisory and legacy/Python labelling is required before using older examples. Learners mark `Pending` until they can run the matching Rust build/test/check commands and explain each gate.

## Overview

A structured learning pathway from beginner to NT developer. Walks through installation, examples, concepts, and progressively deeper implementation — from Python strategies to Rust internals to full Rust trading systems.

## Workflow

1. Ask: "What's your current level with NautilusTrader?"
   - **Brand new** → Start at Stage 01
   - **Can run examples** → Start at Stage 03
   - **Can write strategies** → Start at Stage 05
   - **Want to learn Rust internals** → Start at Stage 08
   - **Want to write full Rust trading systems** → Start at Stage 09
   - **Want to build/extend NT** → Start at Stage 10
2. Work through stages sequentially from entry point
3. Each stage has concepts, exercises, and a checkpoint
4. Ask user for local NT path at first source exploration
