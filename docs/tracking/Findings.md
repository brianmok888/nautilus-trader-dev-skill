## Closed in current working tree

### Repository scope matches the master prompt

- Removed the AI/EvoMap skill lane, sidecar, templates, tests, and G2 evidence.
- Removed completed plans, reconciliation reports, handoffs, generated agent state, obsolete cutover-attestation tooling, and stale scaffolding.
- Rewrote the `nt` router and current repository indexes to cover NautilusTrader development only.
- Preserved upstream NautilusTrader as read-only evidence rather than an implementation target.

### Current upstream review incorporated

- Reviewed `origin/develop` through `9ca072e2d98ae623f14ecaa5b336398f5d25de34`.
- Added 98 exact commits to `references/upstream-delta-review.json`, oldest first, with changed paths and affected-skill mappings or no-impact rationales.
- Updated `nt-testing` for current Rust data and execution tester APIs while retaining explicit pin/current version boundaries.

### Python test environment split is fail-closed

- The static DEX compliance test is the sole explicit host-Python allowlist entry.
- All runtime API tests continue to require the pinned upstream interpreter and report setup guidance when it is absent.

## Current closure gates

- Full repository pytest suite.
- Developer-guide, snapshot, Rust-reference, legacy-labelling, and freshness validators.
- All 17 retained G0-G7 cards and G2 evidence hashes.
- NT-only repository boundary tests and manual router inspection.

No readiness claim is valid until those gates pass in the final working tree.
